      - role: Big Data Intelligent Storage at the Network Edge
        time: Oct.2018 — May.2019 | advised by Prof.Jun Wu
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai
        details: |
            - Proposed a novel unified storage architecture for big data in the edge-cloud, which supports edge services in order to extend Hadoop at the edge. 
            - Devised a dynamic storage policy-making mechanism based on Q-learning.
            - Showed task processing delay is reduced by 30% and the lowest economic cost is reduced by 15%.
      - role: Trustworthy Edge Storage in Intelligent Transportation Systems
        time: Aug.2019 — Jun.2020 | advised by Prof.Jun Wu
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai
        details: |
            - Proposed a distributed trustworthy storage architecture with reinforcement learning in ITS.
            - Devised a trust evaluation mechanism based the interaction between cooperative devices.
            - Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed distributed trustworthy storage architecture outperforms the comparison ones in terms of trustworthiness and efficiency. 
      #- role: Task scheduling problem in edge/cloud computing scenarios
        #time: Apr.2020 — Jun.2020 | advised by Gang Liu
        #company: NOKIA SHANGHAI BELL, Bell Labs & CTO China, FN
        #details: |
            #- Proposed resource scheduling of edge nodes based on multi-dimensional binning problem.
            #- Designed greedy binning algorithms with different objectives for Waste-oriented best-fit and Transmission-oriented best-fit.
            #- Compared the transmission costs, resource consumption costs, and the waste rate of edge node CPU and Memory under different schemes.
      - role: Optimization of Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment based Reinforcement-Learning 
        time: Jan.2018 — Jun.2018 | advised by Prof.Guanghui Wen
        company: Southeast University, Nanjing
        details: |
            - Proposed a new centralized Q-learning algorithm and a novel distributed Q-learning optimization algorithm based on First order discrete time average uniform theory.
            - Simulation results showed distributed algorithms found optimal strategies 100 times faster in the searching process based on 15000 trials.
      - role: Attitude stabilization of rigid spacecraft control problem based on quaternion
        time: Dec.2015 — May 2017 | advised by Prof.Wenwu Yu
        company: Southeast University, Nanjing
        details: |
            - In realistic situation, it's hard to obtain the upper bound of the disturbance in spacecraft attitude stabilization.
            - Proposed a novel adpative control law with sliding mode controller and designed the Lyapunov function to solve the stabilization of the nonlinear system.
            - Proved the system under the designed protocol can be bounded in fixed time without upper bounds of inertia uncertainty and external disturbance.
