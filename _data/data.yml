    papers:
      - role: Big Data Intelligent Storage at the Network Edge
        time: Oct.2018 — May.2019
        company: Information Content Analysis Technology Engineering Laboratory, SJTU
        details: |
            - Lacking a unified edge storage architecture can cause obstacles of data sharing in different edge computing systems.
            - Proposed a novel unified storage architecture for big data in the edge-cloud, which supports edge services in order to extend Hadoop at the edge.
            - Devised a dynamic storage policy-making mechanism based on Q-learning.
            - Simulation results showed that the task processing delay and the minimum cost of the proposed architecture are better than the traditional method.
      - role: Trustworthy Edge Storage in Intelligent Transportation Systems
        time: Aug.2019 — Present
        company: Information Content Analysis Technology Engineering Laboratory, SJTU
        details: |
            - Based on the edge intelligent storage architecture proposed in the previous work, applied it to intelligent transportation systems, and the security is also considered.
            - Proposed a distributed trustworthy storage architecture with reinforcement learning in ITS, and proposed a trust evaluation mechanism based the interaction between cooperative devices.
            - Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed distributed trustworthy storage architecture outperformed the comparison ones in terms of trustworthiness and efficiency.
      - role: Optimization of Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment based Reinforcement-Learning in Smart Grid 
        time: Jan.2018 — Jun.2018
        company: Network Group Intelligence Laboratory, SEU
        details: |
            - In order to achieve the transition from traditional power systems to smart grids, economic dispatch and unit commitment issues need to be re-solved.
            - Proposed a new centralized and a novel distributed optimization algorithm based on Reinforcement-Learning.
            - Simulation results showed that distributed algorithms found optimal strategies faster than centralized algorithms.
      - role: Attitude stabilization of rigid spacecraft control problem based on quaternion
        time: Dec.2015 — May 2017
        company: Network Group Intelligence Laboratory, SEU
        details: |
            - Hard to obtain the upper bound of the disturbance in spacecraft attitude stabilization.
            - Proposed a novel adpative control law with sliding mode controller and designed the Lyapunov function.
            - Proved the system under the designed protocol can be bounded in fixed time without upper bounds of inertia uncertainty and external disturbance.
